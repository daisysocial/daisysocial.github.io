		Another notification. Another mindless scroll session. Another hour sacrificed to the algorithm gods that seem to run our lives today.
	
		Social media today isn't built for <em>you</em>, it's built to keep you hooked. It's a trap. A cycle of non-stop low-effort zero-thinking decisions made by a black box about what you should watch, what you should be interested in, and how long you should stay there.
	
		But what if social media wasn't like that? What if it were a place where you could, you know, <strong>be social?</strong>

		No doomscrolling, no engagement traps or tricks, no rabbit hole black holes, no shady tracking, no studying users under a microscope. Just a space to post whatever's on your mind. Posts are short and sweet (150 characters), feeds are transparent, and content isn't controlled by a faceless algorithm. It's curated for you from information you provide or choose to provide<sup>a</sup>, not curated at you from information creepily extracted from how you behave.

		Why should you switch?
		<ul>
			<li><b>feeds that actually make sense</b> — chronological, niche-based, location-aware<sup>a</sup> feeds, not just what gets the most clicks.</li>
			<li><b>bloom</b> — because great posts shouldn't be hidden beneath influencer noise.</li>
			<li><b>stickies</b> — ephemeral, interactive, supremely fun.</li>
			<li><b>zero tracking</b> — no creepy data collection, just niche-based content discovery.</li>
			<li><b>developer friendly</b> — because good bots and 3rd party apps make the internet better.</li>
		</ul>
